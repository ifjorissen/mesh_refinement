## Mesh Refinement
Isabella Jorissen
Math 385


###What:
  A computer graphics assignment to write the refinement procedure for an object. The object is winged edge data structure and the refinement. The code for this assignment was minimal, and largely confined the the `refine()` method of the object class in we.py.
  
### To run:
  * `python3 object-view.py`
  * press '/' to view the mesh, SPACE to refine the mesh, ESC to quit.
  * see screengrabs folder

####Known Bugs:
  For some reason, there's a slight twisting in the mesh, likely an error in the algorithm for refinement and the calculation of the new vertex positions.
